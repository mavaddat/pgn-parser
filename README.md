# pgn-parser


The pgn-parser library is a java parser for pgn files.
It can parse pgn, xml and json files to java objects and create pgn, json and xml files from java objects.

This parser respects the official pgn file definition but does not implement (yet) all the pgn 
notation.

The xml file and its definition is not official as the pgn notation. 
The json file is not official as the pgn notation.
